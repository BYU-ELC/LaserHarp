# LaserHarp
Contains code and project files for the Laser Harp project

The Laser harp project accepts inputs from the laser sensors/beams. When a laser beam is is interrupted, the consequent signal will be converted into a musical/audio output corresponding with the 'string' played. As such, this functions generally as an classical harp, simply implementing the lasers to operate as harp strings.
